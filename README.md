This was used to copy bulk .zip files (~80,000) then extract them keeping underlying file structure.


It will unzip all .bat files in the given directory whilst keeping their underlying file structure. it ignores non .zip files.


It will auto rename the extracted file if there is a duplicate (for example, name.txt will be renamed to name_1.txt).
